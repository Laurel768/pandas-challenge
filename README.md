TRENDS:
Males continue to dominate the fantasy game market, but the females who are playing are keeping up with the males in terms of purchasing.  It would be worth examining the items the females are purchasing to see if there is a type of enhancement they prefer and then offering more of that type.  The data collected for this study does not reveal much about female preferences as they purchased 90 different items. 

Item prices vary greatly, from $1.00 to $4.99.  The client may want to consider changing some of the prices to end in $X.X9.  There is a psychological effect where a person doesn't think of $3.99 as almost $4.00, but ignores the 99 cents and thinks of it as $3.00.  Also, items under $1.00 might be more appealing to the younger age groups, or more appealing to the parents who approve the purchases of the younger age groups.

Client may want to bundle certain items that are less popular with items that are more popular.  Not only would this increase sales of less popular items, it may introduce new abilities to fantasy characters that a player may not be familiar with, which may lead to more purchases of items that enhance the player's experience similarly.
